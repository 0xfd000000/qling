Qling, the Qt interface for cling
=================================

This is a simple Qt interface for cling, the llvm-based C++ interpreter

This is at a very early stage and definitely needs some love.
At the moment you need to hack some stuff into source files to get it to compile and run correctly, see Compiling...


Compiling
==========

First you need to install llvm, clang and cling from SVN. Follow the instructions at
http://root.cern.ch/drupal/content/cling-build-instructions

Install it to some folder, either system wide or somewhere in your home (speficy via the --prefix
option to llvm's configure-script).
At the moment you need to specify that installation path at a few different places:
qling.pro
main.cpp

In both files you find mentions of "/home/thomas/opt/llvm-debug" - replace this with the installation path
provided to llvm's configure script.

After you've done this:

qmake
make

and

./qling

to start

This mess will definitely be fixed in the next commit, this is just hastily packed up and uploaded to get the
sources out there.


Have fun!
